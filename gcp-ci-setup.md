Create Branch:
Use Git to create a new branch named feature-gcp-ci.
Add Documentation File
Create gcp-ci-setup.md:
In the feature-gcp-ci branch, create a file named gcp-ci-setup.md.
Document the steps required for setting up a CI pipeline using CircleCI on GCP.
Define Pipeline Stages
Configure Pipeline Stages:

a. Build Stage:

CircleCI Configuration: Create a .circleci directory in your repository and add a config.yml file inside it.
Specify the build steps:
Set up the build environment by selecting an appropriate Docker image or machine.
Install necessary tools and dependencies.
Compile the application if necessary.
b. Test Stage:

Continue defining the config.yml file to include a test stage.
Install any dependencies required for testing (e.g., pytest for Python projects).
Execute the test suite.
Collect and publish test results to CircleCI.
c. Deploy Stage:

Deploy to Google Compute Engine (GCE):
In config.yml, create a deploy stage.
Use Google Cloud SDK commands for deployment:
Authenticate with Google Cloud.
Use gcloud commands to deploy the application to your Compute Engine instance.
Ensure the application and its services are started correctly on GCE.
Configure Build Triggers
Set Up Build Triggers:
Webhook Configuration:
Ensure that CircleCI is configured with your repository.
Normally, CircleCI is set to trigger builds automatically on new commits by default. Ensure this is enabled in the Project Settings on CircleCI.
Project Settings in CircleCI:
Navigate to your project in CircleCI.
Set up branch patterns to trigger builds (e.g., include feature-gcp-ci).
Commit and Push Changes
Commit Changes:

Use a clear and descriptive commit message summarizing the changes made.
Example: "Add CI pipeline setup documentation and CircleCI configuration for GCP deployment."
Commit the gcp-ci-setup.md file and any configuration files (like .circleci/config.yml) to the feature-gcp-ci branch.
Push Changes:

Push the feature-gcp-ci branch to the remote repository.
Create Pull Request:

Go to your repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Create a pull request to merge feature-gcp-ci into the main branch.
Review, test, and ensure the CI pipeline runs successfully before merging.
By following these instructions, you will be able to set up a robust CI pipeline using CircleCI on GCP. This setup handles the build, test, and deployment process, deploying applications efficiently to Google Compute Engine.
