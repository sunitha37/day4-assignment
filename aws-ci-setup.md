Step-by-Step Instructions for CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
Configure Jenkins to Build Your Application
Install Jenkins:

Download and install Jenkins on your server or local machine.
Set up and configure Jenkins following the official Jenkins installation guide.
Install Necessary Plugins:

Go to Jenkins Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins.
Install the following plugins:
Git Plugin (for pulling code from your repository)
Pipeline Plugin (for creating CI/CD pipelines)
SSH Agent Plugin (for deploying to EC2 instances)
Set Up the Jenkins Job:

Create a new item/job in Jenkins.
Choose "Pipeline" and name your job appropriately.
Configure Pipeline Script:

Write a Jenkinsfile which includes stages for build, test, and deploy.
Store this Jenkinsfile in your applicationâ€™s repository.
Connect to Your Repository:

In Jenkins, configure Source Code Management (SCM) to connect to your Git repository.
Provide the repository URL and credentials if necessary.
Running Tests in CI Process
Install Required Python Testing Tools:

Make sure your Jenkins environment has the required Python testing tools installed (e.g., pytest).
Add Test Stage in Jenkinsfile:

Inside your Jenkinsfile, create a new stage for running tests.
Define commands to run your test suite (e.g., pytest).
Set Up Reporting:

Configure Jenkins to publish test results.
Use plugins like JUnit or HTML Publisher to display test reports.
Deploy Application to EC2 Instance
Prepare EC2 Instance:

Ensure your EC2 instance is up and running.
Install necessary dependencies on the EC2 instance (e.g., Python, web server).
Configure SSH Access:

Set up SSH keys for Jenkins to access the EC2 instance.
Add the SSH private key in Jenkins credentials (Manage Jenkins -> Manage Credentials).
Add Deployment Stage in Jenkinsfile:

In the Jenkinsfile, create a deployment stage.
Use SSH commands to transfer files and restart services on the EC2 instance.
Configure Build Triggers
Set Up Webhooks:

In your repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab), set up a webhook to notify Jenkins on code changes.
In Jenkins, configure the job to be triggered by SCM changes.
Poll SCM:

Alternatively, you can configure Jenkins to poll the SCM at regular intervals for changes.
Commit and Push Changes
Commit Your Changes:

Write a clear and concise commit message summarizing your changes.
Commit the changes to your local repository.
Push Changes:

Push your changes to the remote repository, specifically to the branch where you are working on CI/CD configurations (e.g., feature-aws-ci).
Create Pull Request:

Go to your repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Create a pull request to merge feature-aws-ci into the main branch.
Ensure all checks pass before merging.
