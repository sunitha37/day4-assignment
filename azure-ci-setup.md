Create Branch:
Use Git to create a new branch named feature-azure-ci.
Add Documentation File
Create azure-ci-setup.md:
In the feature-azure-ci branch, create a file named azure-ci-setup.md.
Document the steps required for setting up a CI pipeline using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps.
Define Pipeline Stages
Configure Pipeline Stages:

a. Build Stage:

GitLab CI: Use .gitlab-ci.yml to define the build stage.
Include build jobs that install dependencies and compile the application.
Azure DevOps: Use azure-pipelines.yml to configure the build stage.
Define tasks for setting up the build environment and building the project.
b. Test Stage:

GitLab CI: Define a test stage in .gitlab-ci.yml.
Ensure to run your test suite (e.g., using pytest for Python projects) and report results.
Azure DevOps: Include a test stage in azure-pipelines.yml.
Add steps to execute tests and collect test results.
c. Deploy Stage:

GitLab CI:
In .gitlab-ci.yml, create a deploy stage.
Use Azure CLI or appropriate deployment scripts to deploy the application to an Azure VM.
Azure DevOps:
Define a deployment stage in azure-pipelines.yml.
Use Deployment Center or Azure Resource Manager templates for deploying to an Azure VM.
Configure Build Triggers
Set Up Build Triggers:

a. GitLab CI:

In GitLab, go to your project settings.
Navigate to CI/CD -> Pipelines -> Triggers.
Create a new trigger to start builds automatically on code changes.
b. Azure DevOps:

In Azure DevOps, configure the pipeline to run on code changes.
Use the trigger section in azure-pipelines.yml to set it to trigger on changes to specific branches or paths.
Commit and Push Changes
Commit Changes:

Use a clear and descriptive commit message.
Commit the azure-ci-setup.md file to the feature-azure-ci branch.
Push Changes:

Push the feature-azure-ci branch to the remote repository.
Create Pull Request:

Go to your repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Create a pull request to merge feature-azure-ci into the main branch.
Review and ensure all CI checks pass before merging.
Setting Up a Basic CI Pipeline on GCP
Document Setup for GCP:
Create a document similar to azure-ci-setup.md for setting up a CI pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Follow similar steps to build, test, and deploy applications using tools like Google Cloud Build.
By following these steps, you can ensure an optimized and efficient CI pipeline setup on Azure, and quickly adapt similar strategies for other cloud platforms like GCP.
